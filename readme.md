### Airbnb Boston
This database is available on Kaggle, [Airbnb Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston). 
It is data on accommodation in the 
city of Boston from September 2016 to September 2017. The competition 
involving these data aims to predict the price of accommodation. 
However, in this project, only an analysis of the data will be presented 
in order to identify alternative accommodation during the Boston marathon period. 

### Data description
1. calendar.csv: contain the date and status of homestay
2. listings.csv: contain the description of each homestay

### The Questions which analysis is answering.
1. Is there a difference in the price of accommodation during the year?
2. What is the most expensive neighborhood? And which is the cheapest?
3. What are the accommodation changes for two people? And for more than two people?

### Conclusion

Boston is a city with many lodging options. The neighborhood that occurs at the end of 
the marathon is among the neighborhoods with the most accommodation options. If the 
desire is to stay close to the arrival of the marathon and pay cheap, there are two 
neighborhoods that I can recommend. South End and Chinatown, the latter being more distant. 
There are many options for accommodation with two accommodations but it may be more 
worthwhile to share an apartment with 4, 5, 6 or 8 people.
